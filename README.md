# TikTok
# Data were collected from the top 10 TikTokers in the world, according to wikipedia page. 
# The data consists of video descriptions, number of likes, shares and comments for each video etc. 
# We found which words used in the descriptions (hashtags, topics etc) are linked with a big amount of likes. 
# We also trained a model that, based on the description topic, predicts whether the creator is dascer/singer or not.

# The zip file contains the clean data and the extended version of clean data for the last part of the project.
# Enjoy!
